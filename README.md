Hi everyone! My name is Cam Smugereski and I live in NH. Two years ago I took a Data Science bootcamp, and since then I've been working as a Data Analyst for a company in Maine. I enjoyed the bootcamp, but now with a little more real world experience under my belt I'm excited to further develop my skills!
